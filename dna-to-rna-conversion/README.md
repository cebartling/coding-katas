# DNA to RNA Conversion

- [Original CodeWars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5556282156230d0e5e000089)

- Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, is composed of four nucleic acid bases: Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T'). 
- Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is composed of four nucleic acid bases: Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Uracil ('U'). Uracil is a replacement for Thymine ('T').

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

For example:

```
"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
```

- The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. 
- All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.
