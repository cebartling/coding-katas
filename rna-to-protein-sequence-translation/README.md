# RNA to Protein Sequence Translation

- [Original CodeWars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555a03f259e2d1788c000077)

- RNA is tranlsated into protein. 
- Each segment of three bases is called a codon. 
- Ribosomes translate the RNA codons into amino acid chains, called polypeptides, which are then folded into a protein.
- Protein sequences are easily visualized in much the same way that DNA and RNA are, as large strings of letters. 
- An important thing to note is that the 'Stop' codons do not encode for a specific amino acid. 
    - Their only function is to stop translation of the protein, as such they are not incorporated into the polypeptide chain. 
    - 'Stop' codons should not be in the final protein sequence.
